Congratulations friend on being the first to find this puzzle for your team!

It's arts and crafts time! Cut along the lines marked below then tape them together with the numbers
matching each other. Try not to overlap, and be precise!

I am tall when I am young and short when I am old.
I tickle one particular sense more than others, for that is my purpose.
Despite providing light and heat, I'm cold! Wrap me up in this puzzle to get your next clue, and
be sure to start with the smallest at the bottom and the biggest at the top!

You'll have an epiphany of truth and be like the wise men by looking to the right of their number.
